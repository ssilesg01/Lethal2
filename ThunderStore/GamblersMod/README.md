## Description

The gamble roll can have 5 results (these are configurable):

- Jackpot = 10x
- Triple = 3x
- Double = 2x
- Halve = 0.5x (scrap reduced by half)
- Zero = 0x (scrap is worthless)

The default gambling chances (these are configurable):

- Jackpot = 3%
- Triple = 11%
- Double = 27%
- Halve = 50%
- Zero = 9%

## How to use the gambling machine

While holding a scrap, walk up to the machine and press "E" (or your interaction key).
